    <h1>Opps! Today is very lucky day.</h1>
 <p>All is well</p>
 <p>Every matter gets started to reach an end. There is an end to everything. This end is certain. No one can stop it from happening. Nothing is permanent in this world. It may be life, maybe a movie or maybe any other chore. It is made for having an end. It is said that if the end is good then everything is good.
    No one is going to see how much efforts you have done for achieving a particular success. Everyone is going to concentrate on the end result. Therefore it is wisely said that all’s well that ends well.
    If you think about a movie then you can judge every director tries to make a happy ending as he knows that if the end is good, the movie will be considered as good. Let’s compare this with life, suppose one person is born in poor family. He works hard day and night and becomes rich in future. This
    means that person has got an end which is good.</p>
