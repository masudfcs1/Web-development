    <p>Positive thinking doesn't mean that you keep your head in the
       sand and  ignore life's less pleasant  situations. Positive
       thinking just means that you life's less pleasant  situations. Positive
       thinking just means that you approach unpleasantness in a more
        positive and productive way. You think the best is going to
        happen, not the worst.Positive thinking often starts with self-talk. Self-talk is the
       endless stream of unspoken thoughts that run through your head.<br>


  <br>  <br>During another study, women who were more optimistic were less likely to die from cancer, heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and infection.
    And in a study of people over the age of 50, those who had more positive thoughts about aging lived longer. They also had less stress-related inflammation, which shows one possible link between their thoughts and health.
    People with a positive outlook may be more likely to live a healthy lifestyle since they have a more hopeful view of the future. But researchers took that into account, and the results still held.</p>
